"""2404. Most Frequent Even Number

    Given an array of integers, find the most frequent even number in the array. If there are multiple numbers that
    appear the same number of times, return the smallest one. If there are no even numbers in the array, return -1.

    Example 1:
        Input: [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3]
        Output: 2

    Example 2:
        Input: [1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3]
        Output: -1

    Example 3:
        Input: [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]
        Output: 2


    Constraints:
        1 <= nums.length <= 2000
        0 <+ nums[i] <= 10^5 that is, 0 <= nums[i] <= 100000
